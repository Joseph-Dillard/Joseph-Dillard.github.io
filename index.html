            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Howdy! My name is Joseph Dillard, and I’m a <strong>Senior Computer Science major</strong> at Texas A&M University with a <em>strong interest in cybersecurity, software development, and network security.</em> I’m passionate about building secure and efficient systems that balance innovation, usability, and ethical responsibility.
            I currently serve as the Standards Officer for <a href="https://www.gentstamu.com/">Gents TAMU</a>. I’m also part of the Craig and Galen Brown Engineering Honors Program, the Aggie Coding Club, and the A&M Cybersecurity Club. These experiences have strengthened my technical, analytical, and leadership skills through collaboration, research, and real-world problem-solving.</p>

            <h2>Accessibility Interests</h2>
            <p>I'm passionate about accessibility in the world of gaming, cybersecurity, and for those who have been injured/are suffering setbacks. I've been
                involved in a lot of injuries and setbacks in my life, and I know how hard it can be to find resources to help you get back on your feet. I'm interested in finding ways to make the world more accessible for everyone, regardless of their abilities or circumstances.
