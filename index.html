            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Howdy! My name is Joseph Dillard, and I’m a <strong>Senior Computer Science major</strong> at Texas A&M University with a <em>strong interest in cybersecurity, software development, and network security.</em> I’m passionate about building secure and efficient systems that balance innovation, usability, and ethical responsibility.
            I currently serve as the Standards Officer for Gents TAMU. I’m also part of the Craig and Galen Brown Engineering Honors Program, the Aggie Coding Club, and the A&M Cybersecurity Club. These experiences have strengthened my technical, analytical, and leadership skills through collaboration, research, and real-world problem-solving.</p>
